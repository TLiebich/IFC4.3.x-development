## Concepts

### Aggregation


### Approval

Approvals may be associated to indicate the status of acceptance or rejection using the *IfcRelAssociatesApproval* relationship where RelatingApproval refers to an *IfcApproval* and RelatedObjects contains the *IfcPermit*. Approvals may be split into sub-approvals using *IfcApprovalRelationship* to track approval status separately for each party where RelatingApproval refers to the higher-level approval and RelatedApprovals contains one or more lower-level approvals. The hierarchy of approvals implies sequencing such that a higher-level approval is not executed until all of its lower-level approvals have been accepted.



### Control Assignment

Figure 312 illustrates assignment relationships as indicated:


* IfcActor (IfcRelAssignsToActor): Organization issuing the permit such as a local government agency or security organization.


 The IfcPermit may have assignments of its own using the IfcRelAssignsToControl relationship where RelatingControl refers to the IfcPermit and RelatedObjects contains one or more objects of the following types: 

* IfcActor: Organization(s) bound to the permit, typically a single contractor.
