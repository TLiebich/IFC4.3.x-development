# IfcTask

An _IfcTask_ is an identifiable unit of work to be carried out in a construction project.

A task is typically used to describe an activity for the construction or installation of products, but is not limited to these types. For example it might be used to describe design processes, move operations and other design, construction and operation related activities as well.

Quantities of resources consumed by the task are dealt with by defining the _IfcElementQuantity_ for the resource and not at the instance of _IfcTask_.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0. Renamed from _IfcWorkTask_ in IFC2x.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Attributes _TaskTime_ and _PredefinedType_ added. IfcMove and IfcOrderRequest has been removed in IFC4 and are now represented by _IfcTask_. IfcRelAssignsTasks relationship has been removed as well.

Attribute use definition

Each occurrence of _IfcTask_ is given a name that is indicative of its content (_IfcRoot.Name_). A textual description of the task may be provided and this may be further elaborated by a narrative long description (_IfcProcess.LongDescription_). A work method may be declared for the method of work used in carrying out a task. A task is identified as being either a milestone task or not. A milestone task is defined by the marker _IsMilestone_. and has no duration. A status and priority for each task may also be set.

{ .use-head}
Time and duration use definition

Compared to previous IFC releases, basic task time information (scheduled start time, scheduled finish time, duration) is now directly attached to _IfcTask_ through the _TaskTime_ attribute. Regular tasks are defined through _IfcTaskTime_. Recurring tasks are defined through _IfcTaskTimeRecurring_. In case a regular task is derived from a recurring task both tasks should be linked together through a _IfcRelNests_ relationship, where _IfcRelNests.IsNestedBy_ points to the recurring task and _IfcRelNests.Nests_ points to all regular tasks that have been derived from the recurring task.

{ .use-head}
Representation of other activities

The use definitions for _IfcTask_ have been generalised to represent other activities as well, including activities that had been defined by own entities in previous IFC releases. This includes

* Order actions
* Move operations

_IfcTask_ represents an order that might be carried out by a Helpdesk acting the role of interface for the organization between the facility user and the functional requirement of fulfilling their needs. The actual task represented by the _IfcTask_ entity is turning a request into an order and initiating the action that will enable the order to be completed. The _IfcProjectOrder_ or one of its subtypes including maintenance work order, is related to the _IfcTask_ using _IfcRelAssignsToControl_.

_IfcTask_ can also be used to describe an activity that moves people, groups within an organization or complete organizations together with their associated furniture and equipment from one place to another. It thus replaces the previous IFC entity IfcMove. The functionality is represented in _IfcTask_ as follows:

* Move from: The place from which actors and their associated equipment are moving.   Use _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ where _RelatingProcess_ points to the task and _RelatedObjects_ holds the location(s) from which to move.
* Move to: The place to which actors and their associated equipment are moving.   Use _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ where _RelatedObjects_ points to the task(s) and _RelatingProduct_ points to the location to which to move.
* Punch list: A list of points concerning a move that require attention.   Use _LongDescription_ or else identify sub-tasks to track punch list items individually via _IfcRelNests_.

## Attributes

### Status
Current status of the task.
    
> NOTE&nbsp; Particular values for status are not specified, these should be determined and agreed by local usage. Examples of possible status values include 'Not Yet Started', 'Started', 'Completed'.

### WorkMethod
The method of work used in carrying out a task.
    
> NOTE&nbsp; This attribute should not be used if the work method is specified for the _IfcTaskType_

### IsMilestone
Identifies whether a task is a milestone task (=TRUE) or not
    (= FALSE).
    
> NOTE&nbsp; In small project planning applications, a milestone task may be understood to be a task having no duration. As such, it represents a singular point in time.

### Priority
A value that indicates the relative priority of the task (in
    comparison to the priorities of other tasks).

### TaskTime
Time related information for the task.
    
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute added

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a task from which 
    the type required may be set.
    
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute added

## Formal Propositions

### HasName
The Name attribute should be inserted to describe the task name.

### CorrectPredefinedType
The attribute ObjectType must be asserted when the value of PredefinedType is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Classification


An IfcTask may be assigned a Work Breakdown
 Structure (WBS) code. A WBS code is dealt with as a
 classification of task and is associated to a task
 occurrence using the IfcRelAssociatesClassification
 relationship class. As well as being to designate the code,
 the classification structure also enables
 the source of the work breakdown structure classification
 to be identified.



### Constraint


Constraints may be applied to a task to indicate fixed task duration, fixed start or fixed finish, where *IfcMetric*.ReferencePath is set to the corresponding attribute on the *IfcTaskTime* entity.



### Control Assignment


 Occurrences of IfcTask may be assigned to an
 IfcWorkControl (either a work plan or a work
 schedule) through IfcRelAssignsToControl. Please note that the
 IfcRelAssignsTasks relationship class has been
 removed in IFC4 and is no longer available.
 



### Nesting


IfcTask may be contained within an IfcTask
 using the IfcRelNests relationship. An
 IfcTask may in turn nest other IfcTask,
 IfcProcedure or IfcEvent entities. Such
 nesting indicates decomposed level of detail. From IFC4
 onwards it is required to have a summary task (root of all
 tasks), which is used to define a link to the work plan or
 work schedule. All subtasks of the summary tasks are then
 implicitly linked to this work plan or work schedule.
 Please note that the summary task is used for data
 organization and not meant to store typical task
 information as defined by the user. It is therefore
 recommended that the summary task is hidden from the user
 to avoid confusion. Please also note that
 IfcRelNests is used to show the dependency between
 regular tasks and recurring task definitions (please see
 the section about time and duration use definitions).
 



 As shown in Figure 139, the installation of a number of items of equipment within a
 particular space may be the subject of a single task which
 is identified as 'fix equipment in space 123'.
 IfcTask represents the occurrence of a work
 performance of a type of process in a construction plan.

Figure 139 — Task visualization



 A task may nest other tasks as sub-items; the nesting
 relationship is modeled by IfcRelNests as shown in Figure 140. For example,
 the construction of a stud wall may be designated as a
 nesting task named 'install wall #1' including other tasks
 such as 'install dry wall', 'install studs', 'wall taping',
 and 'erect wall' as sub-processes. A value that indicates
 the relative tree view position of the task (in comparison
 to the tree view position of other tasks and the task
 hierarchy defined by IfcRelNests).
 

The task order information that is used for viewing
 purposes is derived from the order defined by the
 IfcRelNests relationship and thus is independent of
 the logical task order defined through
 IfcRelSequence. The hierarchy and order defined
 through IfcRelNests enables to order the tasks in a
 tree view or list view structure.

A top-level task is declared within the *IfcProject* using the *IfcRelDeclares* relationship.


### Object Typing


The IfcTask defines the anticipated or actual occurrence
 of any task; common information about task types is handled
 by IfcTaskType.



> EXAMPLE  It includes fixed
>  duration, fixed unit or fixed work. An IfcTask can be
>  aggregated to a task type in order to specify a task
>  sequence or any time related information, e.g. the duration
>  of a task. Please see the documentation of
>  IfcTaskType for further information.


### Process Assignment


It is suggested to use the 'summary task'
 (root element of the task hierarchy that is required for
 task management purposes) to assign all subtask to a work
 plan or work schedule. Resources used by tasks are assigned by IfcRelAssignsToProcess.



### Product Assignment


### Property Sets


### Sequential Connectivity


 The relationship IfcRelSequence is used to indicate
 control flow. An IfcTask as a successor to an
 IfcTask indicates logical sequence how these tasks
 should be performed. IfcTask's can be triggered or
 can trigger IfcEvent's, which is also defined
 through the relationship IfcRelSequence.
