# IfcOpeningStandardCase

The standard opening, _IfcOpeningStandardCase_, defines an opening with certain constraints for the dimension parameters, position within the voided element, and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The _IfcOpeningStandardCase_ handles all cases of openings, that:

* are true openings where the opening depth is greather than or equal to the thickness of the element, and the _Predefinedtype_ is set correctly to .OPENING.
* are true recesses where the opening depth is lower than the thickness of the element, and the _Predefinedtype_ is set correctly to .RECESS.
* are extruded perpendicular to the wall plane in case of openings in a wall
* are extruded perpendicular to the slab plane in case of openings in a slab
* have a local placement relative to the local placement of the voided element
* have a 'Body' shape representation with 'SweptSolid' representation type
* have only a single extrusion body within the 'Body' shape representation

## Concepts

### Body Geometry

The geometric representation of IfcOpeningStandardCase
is defined using the following multiple shape representations for
its definition:


* Body: A SweptSolid representation defining the 3D subtraction
shape of the standard opening


Body Representation


The body representation of IfcOpeningStandardCase is
represented using the representation type 'SweptSolid'.


Swept Solid Representation Type with Horizontal
Extrusion


The standard geometric representation of
IfcOpeningStandardCase is defined using the 'SweptSolid'
representation. The following attribute values for the
IfcShapeRepresentation holding this geometric
representation shall be used::


* RepresentationIdentifier : 'Body'
* RepresentationType : 'SweptSolid'


The following additional constraints apply to the swept solid
representation:


* Solid: a single IfcExtrudedAreaSolid is
required
* Profile: IfcRectangleProfileDef,
IfcCircleProfileDef and
IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef shall be supported.
* Extrusion: The profile shall be extruded horizontally
(i.e. perpendicular to the extrusion direction of the voided
element) for wall openings, or vertically (i.e. in the extrusion
direction of the voided element), for slab openings.


As shown in Figure 36, the orientation of the opening profile that is extruded
for the opening body shall guarantee the following interpretation
of dimension parameter for rectangular openings:


* IfcRectangleProfileDef.YDim interpreted as
opening width
* IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim interpreted as
opening height

### Placement

The following constraint is mandatory for
IfcOpeningStandardCase


* The PlacementRelTo relationship of
IfcLocalPlacement should point to the local placement of
the same element, which is voided by the opening, i.e. referred
to by VoidsElement.RelatingBuildingElement.
