# IfcProjectionElement

The projection element is a specialization of the general feature element to represent projections applied to building elements. It represents a solid attached to any element that has physical manifestation.

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; A wall projection such as a pilaster strip is handled by _IfcProjectionElement_

> NOTE&nbsp; View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict the types of elements to which _IfcProjectionElement_ can be applied.

An _IfcProjectionElement_ has to be linked to a element (all subtypes of _IfcElement_) by using the _IfcRelProjectsElement_ relationship. Its existence depends on the existence of the master element. The relationship implies a Boolean union operation between the volume of the projection element and the volume of the element.

The _IfcProjectionElement_ shall not participate in the containment relationship, i.e. it is not linked directly to the spatial structure of the project. It has a mandatory _ProjectsElements_ inverse relationship pointing to the _IfcElement_ that is contained in the spatial structure.

* The inverse relationship _ContainedInStructure_ shall be NIL.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Predefined generic type for a projection element that is specified in an enumeration. There may be a property set given specificly for the predefined types.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute has been added at the end of the entity definition.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either _PredefinedType_ is unset or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED or _PredefinedType_.

## Concepts

### Body Geometry

The geometric representation of IfcProjectionElement is
defined using the swept area solid geometry. The following
attribute values for the IfcShapeRepresentation holding this
geometric representation shall be used:


* RepresentationIdentifier : 'Body'
* RepresentationType : 'SweptSolid'


The following additional constraints apply to the swept solid
representation:


* Solid: IfcExtrudedAreaSolid is required.
* Profile: IfcRectangleProfileDef,
IfcCircleProfileDef and IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef
shall be supported.
* Extrusion: The profile shall be extruded horizontally
(that is, perpendicular to the extrusion direction of the modified
element), such as for wall projections, or vertically (that is, in the
extrusion direction of the projected element), such as for floor
projections.


As shown in Figure 162, the following interpretation of dimension parameter applies for
rectangular projection:


* IfcRectangleProfileDef.YDim interpreted as projection
width
* IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim interpreted as projection
height
* IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Depth is interpreted as projection
depth



> NOTE  Rectangles are now defined centric, the placement location has to be set:
> * IfcCartesianPoint(XDim/2,YDim/2)
> 



> NOTE  The local placement directions for the IfcProjectionElement are only given as an example, other directions are valid as well.

Figure 162 — Projection representation


The general b-rep geometric representation of
IfcProjectionElement is defined using the Brep geometry. The
Brep representation allows for the representation of complex
element shape. The following attribute values for the
IfcShapeRepresentation holding this geometric representation
shall be used:


* RepresentationIdentifier : 'Body'
* RepresentationType : 'Brep'



### Placement

The local placement for IfcOpeningRecess is defined in
its supertype IfcProduct. It is defined by the
IfcLocalPlacement, which defines the local coordinate system
that is referenced by all geometric representations.


* The PlacementRelTo relationship of
IfcLocalPlacement should point to the local placement of the
same element, to which the projection adds, i.e. referred to by
ProjectsElement.RelatingBuildingElement.
